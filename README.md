## Project: Assessing Public Knowledge on Climate Change and Emerging Infectious Diseases

This project aims to evaluate the general public's understanding of the Impact of Climate Change on Emerging Infectious Diseases.

Data for this study was gathered via questionnaires distributed through Google Forms across various social media platforms, including Facebook, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp.

The sample size for this project consisted of over 200 participants from more than 10 countries. Gender balance was ensured within the study, and participants from diverse educational backgrounds and fields of study were included.

Analysis of the results revealed a significant disparity in knowledge regarding the impact of climate change on infectious diseases between individuals with backgrounds in life sciences and those without.

Among the top four countries represented in the study, notable differences were observed between Ethiopia and Uganda, Ethiopia and Nigeria, as well as Eritrea and Uganda.

Only 14% of participants demonstrated a satisfactory level of knowledge concerning the effects of climate change on infectious diseases.

The internet emerged as the primary source of information on climate change and infectious diseases for the participants surveyed.
